# Users Management

Users information has been introduced in [schema update 08](../server/db/satnogs-08.psql). There's a new table that holds
user-id, username, salted SHA256 digest, and user role. Until we add flask-admin (or some other management panel), the
process of adding new users is manual.

This is pretty basic for now. One day we will add a capability for the user registration.

To add a new user:

1. log into the server using ssh
2. psql satnogs
3. add entry for new user

```sql
INSERT INTO users(id, username, digest, email, role)
VALUES(1,
       'admin',
       'pbkdf2:sha256:150000$kTuJClSh$2e93de2d7a169df346a577a24ccc85c2cf1ff62e5a64f944a301cda76ce39c68',
       'spam@wp.pl',
       'admin');
```

You can generate the hash using the following python commands:

```python
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash
generate_password_hash('secret1')
```
